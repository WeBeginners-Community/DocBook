# Selection Sort

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

## Working of Selection Sort
1. Set the first element as minimum.

2. Compare minimum with the second element. If the second element is smaller than minimum, assign the second element as minimum.

Compare minimum with the third element. Again, if the third element is smaller, then assign minimum to the third element otherwise do nothing. The process goes on until the last element.

3. After each iteration, minimum is placed in the front of the unsorted list.

4. For each iteration, indexing starts from the first unsorted element. Step 1 to 3 are repeated until all the elements are placed at their correct positions.

## Pseudo Code

selectionSort(array, size)
  repeat (size - 1) times
  set the first unsorted element as the minimum
  for each of the unsorted elements
    if element < currentMinimum
      set element as new minimum
  swap minimum with first unsorted position
end selectionSort

## Selection Sort Complexity
