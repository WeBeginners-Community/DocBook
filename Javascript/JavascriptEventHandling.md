• Introduction:

Whenever there is any change in the state of an object is known as an Event. In html, there are various events which represents that some activity is performed by the user or by the browser. When javascript code is included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the events is called Event Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event Handlers.

For example, when a user clicks over the browser, add js code, which will execute the task to be performed on the event.

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

                            <element event='some JavaScript'>

            
• Sample code of Event Handling:

    <!DOCTYPE html>

    <html>

    <body>

    <button onclick="document.getElementById('dem').innerHTML=Date()">The time is</button>

    <p id="dem"></p>

    </body>

    </html>

• Code Explaination:

In the above example ,whenever any user clicks on the button so at that time "onclick" event or action takes place which then JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo".It will display the current date after executing the Date function which is present in the code.

• Mouse events:

• Keyboard events:


          Event Performed	 Event Handler	      Description
          Keydown & Keyup	 onkeydown & onkeyup	When the user press and then release the key
          
• Window/Document events:

    EventPerformed	Event Handler	 Description
    load	          onload	       When the browser finishes the loading of the page
    unload	        onunload	     When the visitor leaves the current webpage, the browser unloads it
    resize	        onresize	     When the visitor resizes the window of the browser

• JavaScript Event Handlers:

     1)Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:

     2)Things that should be done every time a page loads.

     3)Things that should be done when the page is closed.

     4)Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button.

     5)Content that should be verified when a user inputs data.
     
• JavaScript addEventListener():

The addEventListener() method is used to attach an event handler to a particular element. It does not override the existing event handlers. Events are said to be   an essential part of the JavaScript. A web page responds according to the event that occurred. Events can be user-generated or generated by API's. An event listener is a JavaScript's procedure that waits for the occurrence of an event.The addEventListener() method is an inbuilt function of JavaScript. 

    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html>  
    <body>  
    <p> Example of the addEventListener() method. </p>  
    <p> Click the following button to see the effect. </p>  
    <button id = "btn"> Click me </button>  
    <p id = "para"></p>  
    <script>  
    document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", fun);  
    function fun() {  
    document.getElementById("para").innerHTML = "Hello World" + "<br>" + "Welcome from Amit";  
    }  
    </script>  
    </body>  
    </html>  
 
• Code explaination:

    The above code simply states that whenever the button is clicked so just execute the fun() function and it will do that.
