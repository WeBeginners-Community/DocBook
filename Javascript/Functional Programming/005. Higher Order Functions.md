# Higher Order Functions 

In mathematics or in programming it means same thing, it takes function as a parameter and return a function.

e.g.: <code>
function hof(fn){
    return fn(4);
}

hof(function a(x){
    return x;
})

</code>

The above code takes the function as an input and returns a function as an output.

> As functions are first class citizens in javascript, the concept of closures also applies to them albeit we must be careful to not modify the outside state.
