# Constructor Function

We use constructor function is used to build object using a function. It is a completely normal function, the only difference is we call constructor function using a new operator.

> Constructor Function always starts with capital letter.

e.g.: <code>

const Human1=function(name, age){

}

const Human2=function(name, age){

this.name=name;
this.age=age;

}

const john=new Human1("John",30);

console.log(john) //output: Human1 {}

const jane=new Human2("Jane",30);

console.log(jane) //output: Human2 { name:"Jane",age:"30"}
</code>

### What happened in above code

1. New empty object {} is created
2. A function is called and the **this** keyword will point to that object., this={}.
3. The new object is linked to(`__proto__` property) to a constructor's function prototype property (e.g.: `Human.prototype`).
4. The object that was created initially is automatically returned and the object does not need to be empty.

In the above code when the this keyword does not assign our object to a property it returns a empty object.

> A arrow function can't be used for constructor functions since it doesn't have its own this keyword.
