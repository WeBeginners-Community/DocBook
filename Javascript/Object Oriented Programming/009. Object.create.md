# Object.create

Third way to create a prototypal inheritance. But here there is no constructor function and no new keyword and no prototype property. So we use **object.create** to manually set the prototype of an object

e.g.:<code>

const PersonProto={

    calcAge(){
        console.log(this.birthYear-2000);
    }


    init(firstName,lastName,birthYear){

        this.firstName=firstName;
        this.lastName=lastName;
        this.birthYear=birthYear;

    }

}

const john=Object.create(PersonProto)
john.init("john","doe","2010")

</code>

**init** in the above example is not a reserved keyword, but it can act as constructor for the object created using **Object.create** method.
**Object.create** creates a new object,and the prototype of that object will be the object that we passed in.
