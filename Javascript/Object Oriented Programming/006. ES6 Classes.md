# ES6 Classes

They are just the syntactic sugar of the traditional classes, they use prototype inheritance behind the scenes. They are created to make it easier for developers from other languages to do OOPS in JavaScript.

e.g.: <code>
//class expression

const Person1=class{

}

//class declaration
class Person2{

constructor(firstname,lastname){

this.firstname=firstname;
this.lastname=lastname

}

calcAge(){
console.log("My name is " + this.firstname)
}
}

const john=new Person2("John","Doe");

</code>

In class expressions, it works since classes are just functions in javascript.The constructor is the built-in function that just works like constructor in constructor function. And whenever the object is created using **new** keyword, it calls the constructor method.

> Note: All the methods we define in the class is actually applied to the prototype of the object not the object themselves.

## Some important points

1. Classes are not hoisted (i.e., we cannot use them before their declaration).
2. Classes are first class citizens.
3. Classes are executed in the strict mode.

> Note: It is upto personal preference to either use the constructor function or the ES6 classes, but learn how constructor functions works.
