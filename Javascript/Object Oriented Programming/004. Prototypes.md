# Prototypes

Each and every function in javascript has a property called _prototype_. And a property for that function can be using the prototype.

e.g.:
<code>

const Human=function(name, age){

this.name=name;
this.age=age;

}

const john=new Human("John",30);

Human.prototype.print=function(){
console.log("My name is "+this.name+" and I am "+this.age+" years old.");
}

john.print() //output: "My name is John and I am 30 years old.
</code>

To see the prototype of a function simply print "Function name._prototype_"

We can also set properties on prototype nopt just methods.
e.g.:

<code>

Human.prototype.species="Homo sapiens"
</code>

But the above property is not its own but a inherited property.

To check if a constructor function own property simply type "function name.hasOwnProperty('property name')".It will return a boolean value.
