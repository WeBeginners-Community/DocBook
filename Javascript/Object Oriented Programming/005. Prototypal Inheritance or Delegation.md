# Prototypal Inheritance or Delegation

If a property or method is not present in  a object, javascript will look for its prototype. It is known as property inheritance or delegation.

It is very performance efficient since all the object does not carry the property or method if they does not need that. Only when it is required, object will delegates their behavior to its prototype.

## Prototype chain

If a object will look up to its prototype for the methods or properties, if it is not present that prototype it will look up to its prototype (Every object in javascript has a prototype).
