# Inheritance in Constructor Functions

e.g.: <code>
const Person=function(firsName,lastName){

    this.firstName=firstName;
    this.lastName=lastName;

}

const Student=function(firstName,lastName,rollNo){

//Person(firstName,lastName); //will not work

Person.call(this,firstName,lastName);

}



Student.prototype=Object.create(Student.Prototype)

Student.prototype.introduction=function(){

    console.log("I am"+ this.firstName+ " "+ this.lastName+ " and my roll No is "+ this.rollNo)

}

const john=new Student("John","Doe",7)

</code>

Calling simply with Person will not work since it will not set the this keyword on that, to rectify this we need to use the call method on Person to give it a **this** keyword as the first argument.

To connect the prototype of student to the person prototype we need to use **Object.create()**
