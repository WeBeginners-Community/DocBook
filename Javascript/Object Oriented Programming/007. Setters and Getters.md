# Setters and Getters

Every object in javascript can have getters and setters. They are known as accessors properties and the normal methods are called as data properties.

e.g.: <code>
const bankAccount={

name:"John",
movements:[100,200,550,150]

get latest(){

return this.movements.slice(-1).pop()

}

set latest(movements){

this.movements.push(movement);

}

console.log(bankAccount.latest) //output: 150
bankAccount.latest=50
}

</code>

We did not call the getter as the method but instead as a property, and also the setter methods can be set as a property of the object.

Similarly, getter and setter can be used in classes.

>Note: Setters and getters can be used for data validation in the classes like setting a property that already exists.
