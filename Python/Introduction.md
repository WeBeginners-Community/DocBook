# What is Python?
**Python** is a simple and easy to understand language which feels like reading simple english. This Pseudo Code nature of python makes easy to learn and understandable by beginners.

# Features of Python
- Easy to understand.
- Less development time.
- Free and open source.
- High level language.
- Portable i.e. works on Linux/Windows/Mac.

# Printing Text
In Python, we use the **print** function to output text.
So to generate our message, the code would look like this: <br>
```
print('Hello world!')   // Output: Hello world!
```

# Data Types & Variables
## Data Types:
Each value in Python has a type.

- Text, like "Hello world", is called a **string**.
- Whole numbers are called **integers**. Example:- 5, 10, -2, 0
- And numbers with a decimal point are called **floats**. Example:- 7.6, 3.5, 6.0

## Variables:
A **variable** lets you store a value by assigning it to a name. The name can be used to refer to the value later in the program.

To assign a variable, use one equals sign
```
user = "James"  //now user variable contains the value James
```

Naming a variables is pretty flexible. We can use **letters**, **numbers**, and **underscores** in variable names. But we can’t use special symbols, or start the name with a number.

# Simple Operations
Doing a **calculation** in Python is simple, just enter it into the print statement: <br>
```
print(2 + 2)        //prints 4
print(5 + 4 - 3)    //prints 6
print(10 / 2)       //prints 5.0
print(2 * (3 + 4))  //prints 14
```

# Exponentiation
Exponentiation – which is what we call it when we raise one number to the **power** of another. The exponentiation operation is performed using two asterisks. <br>
Like this:
```
print(2 ** 5)       //prints 32 i.e. 2 to the power 5
print(9 ** (1/2))   //prints 3 i.e square root of 9
```

# Quotient & Remainder
## Quotient:
Floor division is done using **two forward slashes** and is used to determine the quotient of a division. Quotient just means the quantity produced by the division of two numbers.

And Floor division is just like a normal division operation except that it returns the largest possible integer. This integer is either less than or equal to the normal division result.

For example:
```
print(20 // 6)  //The code above will output 3, because 6 goes into 20 
                //three times, and is the largest possible integer.
```

## Remainder
We can use the **modulo operator** – which is carried out with a percent symbol **(%)** to get the remainder of a given division.

For example:
```
print(20 % 6)       //This will output 2
print(1.25 % 0.5)   //This will output 0.25
```

# Libraries in Python

Python has a vast collection of libraries that can be used for a wide range of tasks. 

## Here are some commonly used libraries in Python:
- NumPy: NumPy is a library for scientific computing that provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, linear algebra, and statistical operations.
- Pandas: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures for efficient handling of data, and methods for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides support for various types of plots, including line, bar, scatter, and pie charts.
- SciPy: SciPy is a library for scientific computing that builds on top of NumPy. It provides support for optimization, integration, linear algebra, and other scientific tasks.
- Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning in Python. It provides support for various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
- TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a library for machine learning and deep learning in Python. It provides support for building and training neural networks, and supports both CPU and GPU computations.
- Flask: A lightweight web application framework for Python, providing tools for building web applications and APIs.
- Django: A high-level web framework for Python, providing a full-stack framework for building web applications.

These are just a few examples of the many libraries available in Python. The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a great resource for discovering and downloading Python libraries.
