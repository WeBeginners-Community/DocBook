### INTRODUCTION TO REACTJS!

# What is React?
React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
React is a tool for building UI components.
It is basically a tool for developers to create Single page web applications.
## Here single page web applications does not mean websites containing only a single page. It mean it doesn't reload the whole website on change of routes. it reloads only that content that has to be changed on change of a route. Hence,
React only changes what needs to be changed!

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
### How does React Work?
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

For working with ReactJs, you first will need to include it's package for which you will need npm. And for npm ypu will need
# Nodejs in.

After that, for React package installation, run the following command on your command prompt by opening the particular directory where you want your project to be-
## npm create my-react-app 'your_project_name'
by this, all your essential files,folders,modules will be installed in your opened repository.


## Step-by-step commands to install ReactJs package and its files!
-- Open the folder where you want to install the package
-- Double click on this location URL and type "cmd" to open Command prompt.
-- Command prompt appers as a dialog box with the folder opened.
-- Run the command "npm create my-react-app <<your folder name>> "
&& here you are done with package installation.
