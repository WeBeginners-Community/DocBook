# Create New React App ðŸš€

- Create React App gives the perfect start for building SPAs(Single Page Apps) in React.
- Sets up perfect development environment for using and exploring cool new Javascript features.

#### Make sure you have Node version >= 14.0.0 and npm version >= 5.6.

## To create a project, run the following commands one by one in your terminal:
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
#### (npx is a package runner tool in npm; in case you consider it to be a typo ðŸ™ƒ)

Create React App just creates a frontend build, so you can use it with any backend you want.

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder.

**The latest release of npm is the most recent stable version. When you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed. However, npm is released more frequently than Node.js, therefore,**

### To install latest version of npm :
```
npm install -g npm
```
