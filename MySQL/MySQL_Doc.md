## What is SQL (Structured Query Language)?
During the 1960s, Donald Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce developed **SQL** at **IBM**. It is a Query Language used for maintaining data or databases. Because **SQL** is not a programming language like **Python** or **C++**, it cannot be used for complex programming; it can only be used with databases.
<br> The original name of **SQL** was **SEQUEL** which is short form for **"Structured English Query Language"**. Later, it was renamed **SQL** because **SEQUEL** was a trademark of Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited.

## Why we need SQL?
Database operations, such as inserting, editing, and deleting records, are performed using **SQL**. With **SQL**, you can handle a lot of data very easily, and it's also fast when compared with other data analysis programs like **Microsoft Excel**. Queries in **SQL** are simple to understand because they are written in structured english that anyone can understand.

## What is MySQL?
**SQL** is not a database system, but it is a query language. **MySQL** is a database management system (**DBMS**) that uses **SQL**. In Simple words, **MySQL** is software that works with "**Structured Query Language**". The **Oracle Corporation** developed **MySQL** and it is open-source (free for everyone to use).

## Why we need MySQL?
A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as **MySQL**. Large databases could be handled much faster on **MySQL** than with existing solutions.

## Features of MySQL:
<ul>
<li> <b>Open Source:</b> Open Source means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify the software. Anybody can download the MySQL software from the Internet and use it without paying anything.</li>
<li> <b>Relational Databases:</b> A relational database stores data in distinct tables rather than in a single large storehouse. The database structures are grouped into tabels that are optimised for performance. </li>
<li> <b>Connectivity and Security:</b> Using MySQL, you can access databases remotely from anywhere on the World. Host-based authentication is enabled by passwords that are encrypted during connection.</li>
</ul>
