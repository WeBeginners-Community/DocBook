**Cycle Sort** 
The in-place sorting method known as Cycle Sort reduces the
quantity of writes. It is predicated on the notion that permutation
cycles can be correctly turned with the least amount of writes.



**How it works** 
The algorithm separates the input into sorted and unsorted
portions. Then, iterating over the unsorted portion, it determines where
each piece belongs and writes it there. The proper location of the
element in the array\'s sorted portion is determined by counting the
number of elements that are smaller than the one in question.

The algorithm searches for the following element in the unsorted portion
and repeats the process once the current element has been written to its
proper location. This keeps going until all the components have been
organized.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the cycle sort algorithm:

1\. Start with an array of n items that is not sorted. 2. Set the value
of the variable cycleStart to zero. 3. Evaluate each element in the
collection in relation to each element to its right. Increase cycleStart
if there are any elements that are smaller than the present element. 4.
After comparing the first element with all other elements, continue on
to the next element and repeat step 3 if cycleStart is still 0. 5. Swap
the present element with the first element in its cycle once a smaller
element has been located. Once the current element has returned to its
initial position, the cycle is repeated once more.

Up until all rounds are finished, repeat steps 3-5. The array is now
sorted.



**Complexity** 
In the worst situation, Cycle Sort has an O(n2) time
complexity. In contrast to other O(n2) sorting algorithms like Bubble
Sort and Selection Sort, it does have some benefits. Cycle Sort
minimizes the number of writes to O by only writing to the array when
required.(n). Because of this, it is advantageous when writes are more
costly than reads.



**Advantage** 
One of the advantages of cycle sort is that it has a low
memory footprint, as it sorts the array in-place and does not require
additional memory for temporary variables or buffers. However, it can be
slow in certain situations, particularly when the input array has a
large range of values. Nonetheless, cycle sort remains a useful sorting
algorithm in certain contexts, such as when sorting small arrays with
limited value ranges.



**Disadvantage** 
It is not mostly used. It has more time complexity o(n\^2).
Unstable sorting algorithm.



**Usage** 
This sorting algorithm is best suited for situations where memory
write or swap operations are costly. Useful for complex problems.
